# IN4110: Problem solving with high-level language
This is the repository for the course IN3110/IN4110 at the University of Oslo.
The course provides an introduction to more advanced aspects of the scripting and programming language Python, e.g. object-oriented programming, regular expressions, interaction with the operating system, platform-independent code, efficient design of program systems with time-critical operations, extensions in compiled languages ​​such as C / C ++, data analysis and web programming. The course also provides a basic introduction to the scripting language Bash, testing and documentation of code, and version control system git. The course consists of six assignments, where you will find more information resting within each repository.

## Assignment 1 - Welcome to the World of Git
In this assignment we are introduced to Git, which is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.


## Assignment 2 - Introduction to Bash Scripting
In this assignment we are introduced to BASH, which stands for **Bourne Again Shell**, and it is frequently encountered on Unix systems. It excels at interactivity, supporting command line editing, completion, and recall.


## Assignment 3 - Basic Python Programming
In this assignment we are introduced to Python, which is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.


## Assignment 4 - Python for Image Analysis
In this assignment we are using Python to study images and creating an algorithm for turning ones colorful images of choice into a dramatic grayscale or nostalgic sepia image.


## Assignment 5 - Regular Expression & Web Scraping
In this assignment we will be using regular expression to extract information from web sites and perform simple statistics and data visualization on the data extracted from there. 


## Assignment 6 - Web Programming & Data Analysis
In this assignment, we will be building a web-based visualization of the corona dataset made publicly available by Folkehelseinstituttet
(FHI). The data can be found on the following website https://www.fhi.no/sv/smittsomme-sykdommer/corona/dags--og-ukerapporter/
